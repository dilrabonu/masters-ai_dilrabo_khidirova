Capstone Project: Heart Attack Risk Analysis for Young Individuals
Project Overview
This is a data analysis and visualization agent built with Python and Streamlit, designed to provide insights into the risk factors for heart attacks in young individuals. It includes:

Summarization of data insights using OpenAI GPT.
Health statistics fetched from an external API.
Interactive data visualizations and business insights.
Data preprocessing for machine learning.
Features
Data Summarization with AI:

Uses OpenAI GPT to provide concise summaries of dataset insights.
External API Integration:

Fetches health-related statistics using an external health API.
Interactive Visualizations:

Generate bar charts, line plots, and other visualizations for risk analysis.
Preprocessing for Machine Learning:

Splits the dataset into training and testing sets for further ML tasks.
Streamlit-based UI:

User-friendly interface for interacting with data and visualizations.
